### Problem

Two cats and a mouse are at various positions on a line. You will be given their starting positions. Your task is to determine which cat will reach the mouse first, assuming the mouse doesn't move and the cats travel at equal speed. If the cats arrive at the same time, the mouse will be allowed to move and it will escape while they fight.

You are given _q_ queries in the form of _x_, _y_ and _z_ representing the respective positions for cats and _A_, _B_ and for mouse _C_. Complete the _catAndMouse_ function to return the appropriate answer to each query, which will be printed on a new line.

- If cat _A_ catches the mouse first, print 'Cat A'
- If cat _B_ catches the mouse first, print 'Cat B'
- If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.

For example, cat _A_ is at position _x = 2_ and cat _B_ is at _y = 5_. If mouse _C_ is at position _z = 4_ , it is _2_ units from cat _A_ and _1_ unit from cat _B_ . Cat _B_ will catch the mouse.
